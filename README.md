# SOLID Principles Overview

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that promote clean, scalable, and maintainable software architecture. These principles provide guidelines for organizing and structuring code to enhance its flexibility and readability.

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have a single responsibility or job. This principle encourages modular design, making classes easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This principle encourages the addition of new features without altering existing code, promoting code stability and ease of maintenance.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program. This principle ensures that objects of a superclass can be replaced with objects of a subclass without affecting the functionality of the program.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not need. This principle encourages the creation of specific interfaces for distinct client needs, promoting a more modular and flexible design.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions. This principle promotes a decoupled and flexible codebase by relying on abstractions and dependency inversion.

By adhering to the SOLID principles, developers can create software systems that are robust, scalable, and easier to maintain over time.
